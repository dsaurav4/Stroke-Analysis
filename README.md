## Abstract

This project aims to analyze and predict stroke occurrences using the "Stroke Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle. Various demographic and health-related factors are examined to uncover insights into stroke risk factors. Key findings reveal significant associations between stroke and factors such as hypertension, heart disease, age, average glucose level, BMI, marital status, work type, and smoking status. Logistic regression analysis is utilized to highlight significant predictors of stroke occurrence, aiding in the understanding of the impact of these factors on stroke risk.

## Keywords

- Stroke prediction
- Logistic regression
- Exploratory data analysis
- Demographic factors
- Hypothesis testing

## Research Questions

1. What is the distribution of the predictive physical health factors and demographic factors among individuals in the dataset?
2. How do different factors interact to influence the risk of stroke in a population?
3. Does higher mean age, BMI, and glucose level correlate with an increased risk of stroke compared to individuals with lower values in these parameters?
4. Based on the previous visual and statistical analyses, how do the different factors affect the chance of having a stroke, and how can these be visually represented to aid understanding?

## Materials and Methods

### Data Collection and Preparation

- Dataset: "Stroke Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle.
- Preprocessing: Missing values in the 'BMI' column were imputed using the median value. Categorical variables were appropriately encoded.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Techniques: Histogram plots, count plots, correlation matrices.

## Results

### Distribution of Predictive Factors

- Analysis of the distribution of hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and glucose levels among individuals in the dataset.

### Factors Influencing Stroke Risk

- Correlation analysis and scatter plots to examine relationships between predictor variables and stroke occurrence.

### Hypothesis Tests

- One-sided t-tests for age, glucose level, and BMI to determine significant predictors of stroke.

### Logistic Regression

- Predictors: Age, Heart Disease, Avg Glucose Level, BMI, Hypertension, Gender (Male).

## Conclusion

The study highlights the significant roles of age, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI, hypertension, and gender in predicting stroke risk. The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive risk assessment in stroke prevention and management.
